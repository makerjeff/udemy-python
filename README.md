# Udemy Python Tutorials
Following along with the tutorials and practice here.

## Notes
- Numpy (as np):
    - n.arange(number): Creates a pre-filled array.
    - n.reshape(numberA, numberB, (numberC)): Reshape the current array into a multimensional array.
    - array.T = transpose (not sure how this works yet, but it reformats np arrays...) when using 'for loops'.
    - array.flat = lets you iterate through 1 by 1 in 'for loops'.
    - array.hstack((tuple)) = combine two arrays via a tuple.
    
    
- OpenCV:
    - cv2.imread() opens a file to a numpy array already.
    - print img.shape will give array dimensions.
    - 'glob' module:
        - import glob
        - glob.glob('*.jpg') will find all the types of files in a folder and put them in a list (array)
